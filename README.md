# Semantic-Segmentation-and-Object-Detection-in-Self-Driving-Cars-Mini-Project-
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for semantic segmentation and object detection tailored for self-driving car applications. It uses a U-Net-based architecture for pixel-level scene understanding and YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.
